### What I learned

I learned about like use properties rather to follow someone use it according to own comfort and i learned how to approach when design any layout especially i saw how to alig the icons at the right side by making display block with margin left auto.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="card border-red">
                        <h2 class="card__title">Team Builder</h2>
                        <p>scans our talent network to create the optimal team for your project</p>

                    </div>
```
```css
svg{
    display: block;
    margin-left:auto;
    margin-top: 2rem;
}
```

### Continued development

Well i'm beginner in this development era and try to improve My skills using Projects. so it helps me alot to figureout how to use flexbox and grid layout.


### Useful resources
